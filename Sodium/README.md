Sodium, one of the most known optimization mods for Fabric, has constantly evolved since the first release.

But, as the game requires fairly new devices (Java 16-17 needs at least Windows 8/Server 2012), Sodium is going further and further from older, less capable devices.

This also applies to PojavLauncher, as the best option for compatibility (Zink/VirGL) is still highly experimental and may not work quite well, and the best option for performance (gl4es) has so little capabilities.

I made this patch for demonstrational purposes, since with gl4es, the game will just crash when it starts rendering the world. To try out this thing, make sure you have a low render distance and are at a reasonably high altitude (around Y=200) so that the game will not render any blocks.

With that said, you can download the mod now! (For Fabric 1.18/1.18.1)
